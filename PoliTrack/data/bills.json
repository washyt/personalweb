It also generally prohibits companies from transferring individuals' personal data without their affirmative express consent. The bill establishes consumer data protections, including the right to access, correct, and delete personal data. Prior to engaging in targeted advertising, the bill requires companies to provide individuals with a means to opt out of such advertising. The bill also provides additional protections with respect to personal data of individuals under the age of 17. It further prohibits companies from using personal data to discriminate based on specified protected characteristics. Additionally, companies must implement security practices to protect and secure personal data against unauthorized access, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may issue regulations for complying with this requirement. The bill provides for enforcement of these requirements by the FTC and state attorneys general. Beginning four years after the bill's enactment, individuals may, subject to certain notification requirements, bring civil actions for violations of the bill.
